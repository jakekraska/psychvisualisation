<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
	<li>If Australian norms are selected then some subtests that do not have Australian norms will still be available, as they are commonly utilised by Australian psychologists. These subtests rely on US norms. Examples include:
		<ul>
			<li>WISC-V Verbal (Expanded) Crystallised Index</li>
			<li>WISC-V Extended Fluid Index</li>
			<li>WISC-V Naming Speed Index</li>
			<li>WISC-V Symbol Translation Index</li>
			<li>WISC-V Storage and Retrieval Index</li>
			<li>WISC-V Immediate Symbol Translation</li>
			<li>WISC-V Delayed Symbol Translation</li>
			<li>WISC-V Recognition Symbol Translation</li>
			<li>WISC-V Recognition Symbol Translation</li>
			<li>WISC-V Naming Speed Quantity</li>
			<li>WISC-V Naming Speed Literacy</li>
			<li>All CTOPP-2 Composites and Subtests</li>
			<li>XBA Composites</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>At current, only age based SEM values from the US are available for the WJ IV. Psychological Assessments Australia have been contacted in order to attempt to obtain Australian SEM values.</li>
	<li>If you plot a score and it does not provide a confidence interval, it means that this score does not have SEM values for the necessary age range.</li>
	<li>Because confidence intervals in the Wechsler scales were calculated around the <emphasis>estimated true scores</emphasis> using the <emphasis>standard error of estimation</emphasis>, the confidence intervals calculated in this tool may be approximately 1-2 points different. The scores you put into this tool are called <emphasis>observed scores</emphasis>, and estimated true scores cannot be obtained from the Wechsler scoring instructions. Such a difference is argued to be neglible, and any tool developed
	to visualise Wechsler scores will have this flaw.</li>
