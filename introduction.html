<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>These tools will help psychologists with visualising psychological test data.</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Follow the Steps one by one.</p>
<p>On each tab ensure you have the correct Tests, Indexes, Subtests and Options selected prior to visualising. 
<strong>Each change may force the user to re-input scores.</strong></p>
<p>At current, only age based SEM values from the US are available. Australasian publishers of the WISC-V, WAIS-IV and WJ IV have been contacted. Once available,
an option will be added to allow plotting of confidence intervals based on US or Australian norms.</p>
<p>If you plot a score and it does not provide a confidence interval, it means that this score does not have SEM values for the necessary age range</p>
